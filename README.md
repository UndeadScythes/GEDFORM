# GEDFORM - Alpha-2.1 #

A GEDCOM, or GEnealogical Data COMunication, is a standard developed by the
Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for
exchanging computerized genealogical data. The current standard is version 5.5,
which is documented [here](https://devnet.familysearch.org/docs/gedcom/gedcom55.pdf).

The GEDCOM standard branches from an idea of a GEneral Data FORMat for
exchanging computerized databased data. This project provides access to such
.ged files, providing a useful parsing script which can be used to evaluate or
generate files in this format.
